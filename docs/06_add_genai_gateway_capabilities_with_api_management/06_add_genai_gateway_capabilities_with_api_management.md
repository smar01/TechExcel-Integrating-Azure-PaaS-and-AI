# Exercise 06 - Add GenAI Gateway Capabilities with Azure API Management

## Scenario

Azure API Management (APIM) provides a range of policies, metrics, and other features to enhance security, performance, and reliability for APIs serving your intelligent apps. Collectively, these features are called generative AI (GenAI) gateway capabilities.

In this exercise, you will import your Azure OpenAI service as an API in APIM and enable the *generative AI (GenAI) gateway capabilities*.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this lab, you will have gained the following skills:

- Import an Azure OpenAI Service resource as an API in Azure API Management
- Use APIM policies to manage token consumption and monitor token usage
- Integrate APIM-managed APIs into GenAI applications
- Load balance LLM workloads across two Azure OpenAI service instances (Optional)

## Duration

- **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
