# Task 02 - Summarize and call transcriptions (40 minutes)

## Introduction

The intent of text summarization is to shorten content that users consider too long to read. AI-based summarization focuses on highlighting the most important aspects of the text. Azure AI Services provide several mechanism for summarizing text. The Language service provides extractive and abstractive summarization functions, both of which condense text or documents into key sentences.

- **Extractive summarization**: Creates a summary by extracting sentences that collectively represent the most important or relevant information within the original content.
- **Abstractive summarization**: Produces a summary by generating summarized sentences from the document that capture the main idea.

In addition to the summarization capabilities of the Azure AI Services Language service, the Azure OpenAI service also enables the ability to perform query-based summarization, leveraging the power of large language models. The service uses a generative completion model to generate a summary from text. The model uses natural language instructions to identify the requested task and the skill required, a process known as **prompt engineering**.

In this exercise, you will create an Azure AI Services Language service and compare the outputs of its extractive and abstractive summarization functions to the output of Azure OpenAI's query-based text summarization.

After that, you will take the analysis a step further in this task, extracting named entities and performing sentiment analysis and opinion mining over the same call transcript.

- **Sentiment analysis and opinion mining** are features that help you assess what people think of your brand or topic by mining text for clues about positive or negative sentiment, and can associate them with specific aspects of the text.

## Description

In this task, you use an Azure AI Services Language service to summarize the transcript of a customer call generated in the `4_Call_Center.py` page of your Streamlit application. You will write code to create summaries of a transcribed call recording using three different Azure AI Services capabilities and compare the results from each. Then, you will analyze sentiment and perform opinion mining against the transcript.

## Success Criteria

- You are able to generate extractive and abstractive summaries of a call transcript using the Azure AI Services Language service.
- You are able to generate a summary of a call transcript using your GPT-4o model deployment.
- You are able to perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining using the Azure AI Services Language service.
- You are able to deploy the application to Azure App Services and have the application continue to function as expected.

## Key Tasks

> **Note**: The Quickstart guides in the **Learning Resources** section below will show examples of each of the following techniques.

### 01: Generate extractive summary

Fill in the contents of `generate_extractive_summary()`. To do so, you will need to create a `TextAnalyticsClient` and perform an `ExtractiveSummaryAction()`. Extract at most the **2** most important sentences from the transcript. Generate the extractive summary and return a JSON object including the extractive summary as a string named `call-summary`.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The code to complete the `generate_extractive_summary()` function is as follows:

```python
# Create a TextAnalyticsClient, connecting it to your Language Service endpoint.
    client = TextAnalyticsClient(language_endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(language_key))
    # Call the begin_analyze_actions method on your client, passing in the joined
    # call_contents as an array and an ExtractiveSummaryAction with a max_sentence_countof 2.
    poller = client.begin_analyze_actions(
        [joined_call_contents],
        actions = [
            ExtractiveSummaryAction(max_sentence_count=2)
        ]
    )

    # Extract the summary sentences and merge them into a single summary string.
    for result in poller.result():
        summary_result = result[0]
        if summary_result.is_error:
            st.error(f'Extractive summary resulted in an error with code "{summary_result.code}" and message "{summary_result.message}"')
            return ''

        extractive_summary = " ".join([sentence.text for sentence in summary_result.sentences])

    # Return the summary as a JSON object in the shape '{"call-summary":extractive_summary}'
    return json.loads('{"call-summary":"' + extractive_summary + '"}')
```

This code should **replace** the `return "This is a placeholder result. Fill in with real extractive summary."` line of code.

</details>

### 02: Generate abstractive summary

Fill in the contents of `generate_abstractive_summary()`. To do so, you will need to create a `TextAnalyticsClient` and perform an `AbstractiveSummaryAction()`, with the requirement that it create at most **2** sentences based on the transcript. Generate the abstractive summary and return a JSON object including the abstractive summary as a string named `call-summary`.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The code to complete the `generate_abstractive_summary()` function is as follows:

```python
# Create a TextAnalyticsClient, connecting it to your Language Service endpoint.
    client = TextAnalyticsClient(language_endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(language_key))

    # Call the begin_analyze_actions method on your client,
    # passing in the joined call_contents as an array
    # and an AbstractiveSummaryAction with a sentence_count of 2.
    poller = client.begin_analyze_actions(
        [joined_call_contents],
        actions = [
            AbstractiveSummaryAction(sentence_count=2)
        ]
    )

    # Extract the summary sentences and merge them into a single summary string.
    for result in poller.result():
        summary_result = result[0]
        if summary_result.is_error:
            st.error(f'...Is an error with code "{summary_result.code}" and message "{summary_result.message}"')
            return ''
    
        abstractive_summary = " ".join([summary.text for summary in summary_result.summaries])

    # Return the summary as a JSON object in the shape '{"call-summary":abstractive_summary}'
    return json.loads('{"call-summary":"' + abstractive_summary + '"}')
```

This code should **replace** the `return "This is a placeholder result. Fill in with real abstractive summary."` line of code.

</details>

### 03: Generate query-based summary

Fill in the contents of `generate_query_based_summary()`. This will execute against the GPT-4o model deployment. You should create a system prompt that asks for a five-word summary and label that "call-title". Then, ask for a two-sentence summary and label that as "call-summary". Finally, output the results in JSON format.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The code to complete the `generate_query_based_summary()` function is as follows:

```python
# Write a system prompt that instructs the large language model to:
    #    - Generate a short (5 word) summary from the call transcript.
    #    - Create a two-sentence summary of the call transcript.
    #    - Output the response in JSON format, with the short summary
    #       labeled 'call-title' and the longer summary labeled 'call-summary.'
    system = """
        Write a five-word summary and label it as call-title.
        Write a two-sentence summary and label it as call-summary.
    
        Output the results in JSON format.
    """

    # Call make_azure_openai_chat_request().
    response = make_azure_openai_chat_request(system, joined_call_contents)

    # Return the summary.
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

This code should **replace** the `return "This is a placeholder result. Fill in with real query-based summary."` line of code.

</details>

### 04: Perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining

Fill in the contents of `create_sentiment_analysis_and_opinion_mining_request()`. To do so, you will need to create a `TextAnalyticsClient` and then execute the method `analyze_sentiment()`. The output you will receive is a JSON document in the following shape:

```json
{
    "sentiment": document_sentiment,
    "sentiment-scores": {
        "positive": document_positive_score_as_two_decimal_float,
        "neutral": document_neutral_score_as_two_decimal_float,
        "negative": document_negative_score_as_two_decimal_float
    },
    "sentences": [
        {
            "text": sentence_text,
            "sentiment": document_sentiment,
            "sentiment-scores": {
                "positive": document_positive_score_as_two_decimal_float,
                "neutral": document_neutral_score_as_two_decimal_float,
                "negative": document_negative_score_as_two_decimal_float
            },
            "mined_opinions": [
                {
                    "target-sentiment": opinion_sentiment,
                    "target-text": opinion_target,
                    "target-scores": {
                        "positive": document_positive_score_as_two_decimal_float,
                        "neutral": document_neutral_score_as_two_decimal_float,
                        "negative": document_negative_score_as_two_decimal_float
                    },
                    "assessments": [
                        {
                        "assessment-sentiment": assessment_sentiment,
                        "assessment-text": assessment_text,
                        "assessment-scores": {
                            "positive": document_positive_score_as_two_decimal_float,
                            "negative": document_negative_score_as_two_decimal_float
                        }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Keeping this document shape in mind, create a new dictionary named `sentiment`. For each valid document you receive, set the `sentiment` field to the document's sentiment. Set the `sentiment-scores` field to a dictionary containing the numbers of positive, neutral, and negative statements, respectively.

Then, for each sentence in the document, create a similar sentiment analysis, tracking the sentence itself, its sentiment, and the sentiment-scores (positive, neutral, and negative).

Continue in this vein with mined opinions, tracking those per sentence and mined opinion target text, target sentiment, and sentiment-scores (positive and negative).

For each mined opinion, collect a set of assessments, tracking the text, sentiment, and sentiment-scores (positive and negative). Collect all of this in the `sentiment` dictionary and return it as the output of the function.

### 05: Test and deploy

After filling in these code segments, re-run the application and navigate to the **Call Center** page. Ensure that you can generate a transcript of the sample call audio. Then, run the extractive, abstractive, and Azure OpenAI summaries. After that, run the sentiment and opinions check. For each operation, you should get back valid results relating to the call transcript.

Then, deploy the application and ensure that the functionality behaves as expected as an App Service.
