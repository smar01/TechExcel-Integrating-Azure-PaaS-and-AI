# Exercise 04 - Implement audio transcription using Azure AI Services Speech service

## Scenario

A common use case for call centers is interpreting and transcribing speech from telephone calls, as well as analyzing the contents of these calls. In a real-world scenario, customers may have hooks into their telephony systems that enable programmatic access to the live audio streams. In this exercise, you will use a simpler case: pre-recorded audio files that you can upload into the dashboard application and process.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Incorporate audio file upload and audio transcription into a Streamlit app
* Check whether a call meets compliance requirements
* Vectorize and save call transcripts and summaries into Cosmos DB
* Perform vector search among call summaries and transcripts

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes
