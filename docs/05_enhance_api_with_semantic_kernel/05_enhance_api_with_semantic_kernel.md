# Exercise 05 - Enhance the API with Semantic Kernel orchestration

## Scenario

Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that lets you easily build agents that can call your existing code. You have already assisted Contoso Suites with incorporating Semantic Kernel into their existing API infrastructure.

In this exercise, you will expand on the work you did with Semantic Kernel in Exercise 02 and dive into the LLM orchestration capabilities it provides. By combining Contoso Suites' existing C# and Python code with Semantic Kernel, you will build agents that answer questions and automate processes. You will also use prompt filtering and explore some prompt engineering techniques.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Implement Semantic Kernel orchestration in a .NET API
* Create an agent using Semantic Kernel
* Assign skills to an agent
* Use built-in AI services from Semantic Kernel in your applications

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
